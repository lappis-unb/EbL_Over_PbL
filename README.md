# EBL Over PBL: Data Collection and Analysis Repository

**Abstract**  
*(To be added)*

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the data collection and analysis of two educational methodologies: **Experiential Based Learning (EBL)** and **Project Based Learning (PBL)**. The aim is to support a study comparing these methodologies, focusing on student engagement, contribution metrics, and outcomes associated with each approach.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw data files, including summaries of student contributions categorized by primary language and project.
- `extract_data/`: Holds scripts responsible for data extraction and preprocessing, including `extract_contribution.py` and `extract_user.py`.
- `notebook/`: Jupyter Notebooks used for in-depth data analysis and visualization, including:
  - `contributions_analysis.ipynb`: Analyzes student contributions and identifies trends in primary programming languages.
- `venv/`: The virtual environment containing all dependencies required for this project.

## Analysis Objectives

The study seeks to achieve the following objectives:
1. **Analyze Contributions**: Understand the level and distribution of contributions among students in both EBL and PBL methodologies.
2. **Language Comparison**: Identify which programming languages are most utilized and have the highest contributions in each methodology.
3. **Student Engagement**: Assess average contributions per student and compare engagement levels across methodologies.
